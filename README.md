#Luck Check

##About
This project was completed by Katharine Chen and Scott Dudley for Epicodus (Week#3 Day #3). 

##Description 
The objective of this project is to create a method that checks if a ticket is lucky. In some countries of former Soviet Union there was a belief about lucky tickets. A transport ticket of any sort was believed to be lucky if the sum of the digits on the left half of its number was equal to the sum of digits on the right half.

##Functionality 
```ruby
luck_check("43252") ##return true 
luck_check("4359")  ##return false 
```
